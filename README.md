# Quiz API


## Project
This is the first part of a project that will ultimately become a fully functioning application. The first part involves an API tested through manual testing using a temporary page built with HTML, CSS, JS, and Postman. The second part will be a web application developed in Angular.

## Overview
The application allows users to add questions and assign them to relevant topics. Users can then select the questions they are interested in and randomly draw from a pool of these questions.
The project was created to help study for university exams.
